# This is the README for the Dockerfile

## Here is what each line is doing

1) A base image of alpine node image is being used. The image is tagged as "development" stage for clarity in multi-stage builds.
2) Setting /react-app as the working directory inside the container.
3) Copies package.json and package-lock.json (if present) from the host machine to /react-app directory in the container.
4) Installs Node.js dependencies specified in package.json using npm install.
5) Copies all files from the host machine to the /react-app directory in the container. This includes the source code of the application.
6) Sets the default command to execute when the container starts. In this case, it's ["npm","start"], which typically starts the application defined in the package.json file.
